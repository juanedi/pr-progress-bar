# pr-progress-bar

Little Chrome extension that adds a progress bar when reviewing a Github PR commit-by-commit.

## ðŸ”§ Installation

The extension is not yet published to the Chrome Web Store. You can install it manually by following [these instructions](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/mv3/getstarted/development-basics/#load-unpacked).

TL;DR:
  1. clone this repo
  1. go to `chrome://extensions`
  1. toggle Developer Mode on (upper right corner)
  1. click "Load unpacked"
  1. select the repo's root directory
  1. review permissions and accept if you are OK with that!

## ðŸ‘“ How does it look?

## Did you make the logo?

Nope. It's a placeholder I downloaded for free from http://vecteezy.com/.
